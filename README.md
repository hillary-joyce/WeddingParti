## Inspiration
After being a bridesmaid 3 times in one year, I found the most frustrating part to be managing all of the information.
I was always scrolling through texts, or searching email chains to find the name of a venue or the order number for
a dress.

I thought there had to be a better way. And that's why I made Wedding Parti.

## Features
* Calendar - an interactive calendar allows your parti to see upcoming events at a glance, get details on times and locations, and add new events.
* Image Gallery - Users can save images from the web to use as inspiration or reminders for dresses to buy, bouquets, etc.
* Task Manager - Here, your friends and family can keep track of anything they need to do for your wedding. By breaking to-dos into bigger projects and smaller individual tasks, they can easily manage anything.
