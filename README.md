# WeddingParti
An app for brides and grooms to keep information for their wedding parties organized and in one place.


## What is WeddingParti?
WeddingParti is an all-in-one platform for managing information for your bridesmaids or groomsmen.
The inspiration came from being a bridesmaid in my best friends wedding. The experience was wonderful - but scrolling through texts and searching emails to find the information I needed was a headache. I wanted to create a better way to be a bridesmaid, a simple, elegant app for all the information a member of your wedding party needs. 

## MVP
This project is currently in the planning phases. For an MVP, I plan on creating a demo version of the site that will include:
* A login using Google Authentication or Okta Authentication
* A calendar with important wedding dates
* A resource area that contains important information (dress/suit information, bachelorette party ideas/locations, engagement party details, etc.)
* A forum for members to post new information

## Next Steps
If the MVP goes smoothly, I would like to add:
* Expanding to a phone app
* Full chat feature
* Email notifications when there are updates, etc.

Check back soon for updates!
